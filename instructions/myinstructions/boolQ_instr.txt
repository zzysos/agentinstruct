1. Understand that the BoolQ dataset is a question answering dataset specifically designed for yes/no questions. The questions are naturally occurring, meaning they are generated in unprompted and unconstrained settings.

2. Each example in the dataset is a triplet of a question, a passage, and an answer. The passage is a selected part of a Wikipedia page that contains enough information to answer the question.

3. When answering a question, read the provided passage carefully. The answer to the question lies within the passage.

4. Identify the key information in the passage that is related to the question. This requires good comprehension skills and the ability to extract relevant information.

5. Based on the identified key information, decide whether the answer to the question is 'yes' or 'no'. Remember, the questions are designed to have a yes/no answer.

6. Provide the answer in the form of 'yes' or 'no' or 'true' or 'false'. Do not provide detailed explanations or elaborate answers. The BoolQ dataset is designed for binary answers.

7. Be aware that the questions are associated with a Wikipedia page. This means the questions are factual and the answers can be found within the passage.

8. Finally, remember that the purpose of the BoolQ dataset is to explore the difficulty of natural yes/no questions and to provide a resource for developing and evaluating models for yes/no question answering. Your goal is to correctly answer the question based on the information in the passage.
